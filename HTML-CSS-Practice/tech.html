          <p>The game of golf is unconventional compared to many other sports. Often, the name of the game is to score as many points as possible. In golf, it is the opposite, as your objective is to complete all 18 holes in as few strokes as possible.</p>
          <p>Completing these holes is no easy feat however! Golf courses intentionally put obstacles in the way such as sand traps or water hazards. This creates a unique and intruiging challenge for golfers of all skill levels at every golf course</p>

        <section region="role" aria-labelledby="scoring" class="main-section" id="scoring">
          <header class="description">Scoring</header>
          <p>Scoring in golf is pre-determined by a course par, which is the number of strokes that it should take an individual to complete a hole. From there, your score is referenced relative to that par. There are three kinds of holes on a golf course, all of different pars which are listed below:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Par 3</li>
            <li>Par 4</li>
            <li>Par 5</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The higher the par, the longer the length of the hole. The idea behind these pars is to allow for two putts on every green, therefore you should be on the green on a Par 4 after two shots!

        <section region="role" aria-labelledby="clubs" class="main-section" id="clubs">
          <header class="description">Clubs</header>
          <p>You are allowed to have 14 clubs in your bag as per golf rules and regulations. Typically clubs are split up into four categories:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Putter (1 Club)</li>
            <li>Wedges (4 Clubs)</li>
            <li>Irons (6-7 Clubs)</li>
            <li>Woods/Hybrids (2-3 Clubs)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This is the basic club setup that the majority of golfers use in their sets. It is very much up to customization based on your skill level and comfort.</p>

        <section region="role" aria-labelledby="etiquette" class="main-section" id="etiquette">
          <header class="description">Etiquette</header>
          <p>Listed below are the 5 most basic rules of etiquette that you can follow if you are going out on a golf course for the first time:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Do not talk while someone is hitting their ball.</li>
            <li>Do not walk on the direct line between the ball and the hole of anyone's putt.</li>
            <li>Furthest away from the hole should always play first.</li>
            <li>Follow the dress code set by the course you are playing at</li>
            <li>Be respectful, and have fun!</li>

          <header class="description">Shot Types</header>
          <p>When first learning the game of golf, there are a handful of shots that you should learn to make the game much more enjoyable</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Drives (With all of your woods)</li>
            <li>Basic approach shots (With wedges/irons/hybrids)</li>
            <li>Chip Shots (Higher lofted shots around the green)</li>
            <li>Pitch Shots (Lower lofted shots around the green)</li>
            <li>Lag Putts (Long putts which you just try and get close)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Learning how to hit these shots even at a basic level will make the initial stages of golf much more entertaining</p>

          <header class="description">Time Commitment</header>
          <p>Golf is quite a time-consuming sport, a full 18 hole round will typically take around 4 hours to complete. However, most courses allow you to play nine holes if you're on a time crunch. This allows you to get out and get some holes in after work if you're looking for something to relax.</p>
